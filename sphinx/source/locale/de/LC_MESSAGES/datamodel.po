":ref:`Organizations` are official state or state-sanctioned organizations"
" responsible for the internal or external security for a country, "
"including the police, army, navy, air force and other security forces. "
"Organizations refer to any any part of the hierarchy of a security force,"
" ranging from a national defense ministry, to a police unit based in a "
"small town. Organizations can also be groupings of organizations that "
"occur, such as \"operations\", \"joint task forces\" or peacekeeping "
"missions. The Monitor collects data about an organization's name, "
"aliases, location, geographical areas of operation and relationships with"

"Incidents are publicly-documented allegations of human rights violations "

"bodies, human rights organizations and other civil society actors. For "
"each incident, the Monitor includes a description from the source, "
"date(s), specific location(s), its perpetrators and the type of human "
"rights violation."
