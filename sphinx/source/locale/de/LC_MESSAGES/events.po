"According to Amnesty International: \"On 1 May 2012, around midnight, "
"Nigerian soldiers arrested 37-year-old Dungus Ladan (not his real name), "
"at his home in Maiduguri. Fatima, Dungus’ wife, told Amnesty "
"International that the soldiers promised to just take him for an "
"interrogation that should not last more than a few hours. When her "
"husband did not return, she said, his father went on 3 May to Giwa "
"barracks to check what had happened. Soldiers told him that Dungus had "
"already been released. When he still did not return, the father went back"
" again to the barracks, where soldiers told him that he should come back "
"the next day to bail out his son. The following day, several relatives "
"went together and gave the soldiers “what they could,” and the soldiers "
"again promised to release Dungus that day. His wife said that the "
"soldiers kept asking for money, and the family kept paying, but Dungus "
"was never released. In February 2014, his father saw Dungus in the "
"detention facility; they spoke briefly. Dungus said he had been framed by"
" some people who owed him money and they arranged for him to be arrested "
"and detained. Since then, his family has not seen him again; soldiers at "
"Giwa barracks have told them he is not there.\""
