"For example, the Monitor's scoping research on Nigeria revealed that by "

"Police Force show that between 2007 and 2012 most Police Commands were in"
" charge of 2 to 3 Police Area Commands (though some heavily populated "
"states have more, with Lagos having the most at 8). These statistics also"
" show that on average each state and the federal capital territory had 30"
" Police Divisions, which by law are generally under the command of a "
"Police Area Command. Thus, from a few initial sources a Monitor "

"In an ideal world the Monitor would have a source from every day of the "
"year stating where a unit was located or conducting operations. Barring "
"that, having multiple sources regularly making statements like “since X "
"date this unit has been based in this city” would be tremendously "
"helpful. Unfortunately, neither scenario currently occurs, or is likely "
"to occur in the near future, making it necessary to develop a robust way "
"of thinking through time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:94
msgid ""
"Broadly speaking the Security Force Monitor uses agreement among sources "
"to build up details on security force units and individuals. Most of the "
"Monitor’s sources, like government press releases and newspaper articles,"
" can be used to link a value, such as the location of a unit, to a "
"specific date (usually the date of publication). As we collect more "
"sources we need to determine what agreement among sources means for time "
"based values, like the location of a unit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:96
msgid ""
"Example: the Monitor comes across Source A published on 1 July 2012 "
"stating that the 1 Battalion is based in Lagos. If Source B published on "
"3 August 2012 also states that the 1 Battalion is based in Lagos we have "
"a decision point about what claim we should make."

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:98
msgid ""
"Utilizing sources A and B we have two options which can be expressed in "
"text:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:100
msgid ""
"Separate claims: “As of 1 July 2012 the 1 Battalion was based in Lagos "
"and as of 3 August 2012 the 1 Battalion was based in Lagos, the Monitor "
"does not know where the battalion was based between those two points in "
"time.”"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:103
msgid ""
"Thus, whenever the Monitor gets a new source of information we have to "
"decide whether to make a “separate” or “contiguity” claim. Based on the "
"example of the 1 Battalion above the Monitor would run through a series "
"of questions to determine which claim (if any) to make:"
msgstr ""

"In general, how do other battalions operate, are they sedentary, or "

"How has the 1 Battalion acted in the past, has it been sedentary or "

"Are there other sources disputing these claims (i.e. 1 Battalion being "

"Are there any sources indicating the 1 Battalion was in Lagos in July "
"and/or August as part of a “special”, “emergency” or otherwise temporary "
"posting?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:109
msgid ""
"Are there sources that indicate the 1 Battalion moved in between these "
"two points of time and thus these should be treated as separate "
"deployments to Lagos?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:110
msgid ""
"Is there anything related to the 1 Battalion’s parent or child units that"
" may impact where it was based?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:111
msgid ""
"Are there any other mitigating sources (i.e. major restructuring of the "
"military, constitutional changes, etc.) which may impact the basing of "
"the unit?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:112
msgid "Is more research needed before the Monitor can make any claim?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:114
msgid ""
"An argument could be the Monitor should always make “separate claims” as "
"that would be more faithful to the sources. However, the result likely "
"mean an almost incomprehensible amount of detail in the records of people"
" and units, which would obscure when changes really did occur, for "
"instance when a person changed positions or a unit ends operations in an "
"area."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:116
msgid ""
"Perhaps the most important point is that it even though data points, like"
" where a unit is based, can be continuous through time, it should never "
"be assumed that those types of features remain consistent between two or "
"more sources. Time is a constant challenge, but given that is a key "

msgid "Unknown vs. Unnamed Organizations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:121
msgid ""
"The Security Force Monitor regularly encounters ambiguity in sourcing "
"which it has sought to highlight and resolve through the creation of "
"organizations with \"Unknown\" or \"Unnamed\" in the Organization:name. "
"The methodology behind these decisions is laid out below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:123
msgid ""
"For \"Unknown\" organizations the Monitor will have sources for the "
"overall hierarchical structure of a branch of the security forces, laying"
" out how units should relate to one another up the chain of command. "
"However, the Monitor often will have data on a unit which indicates where"
" it should be in the chain of command, but does not have sourcing for a "
"direct parent. In this case the Monitor creates an organization with "
"\"Unknown\" in the Organization:name and \"Placeholder\" for the "
"Organization:Classification."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:125
msgid ""
"Example: Multiple sources, including the laws of Nigeria, lay out that "
"the chain of command for the Police goes from each state (and the Federal"
" Capital Territory) having a single Police Command, under which are "
"Police Area Commands and under Police Area Command are Police Divisions. "
"For the Abayi Police Division the Monitor has sources placing it in Aba, "
"Abia state, making it ultimately under the control of the Abia State "
"Police Command, per the law. However, the Monitor does not have sources "
"indicating which Police Area Command controls Abayi Police Division, thus"
" the Monitor has created an organization Unknown Police Area Command in "
"Abia State which is the parent of Abayi Police Division. In turn Abia "
"State Police Command is the parent of Unknown Police Area Command in Abia"
" State, which connects Abayi Police Division to the wider police command "
"structure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:127
msgid ""
"For \"Unnamed\" organizations the Monitor will have sources that indicate"
" an organization exists, but it does not give a proper name for that "
"organization. In this case the Monitor will create an \"Unnamed\" "
"organization and continue to update relevant fields related to this "
"organization until such a time that a source is discovered to give it a "
"proper name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:129
msgid ""
"Example: There are several Regional Operations Commands in the army of "
"Myanmar. Many of these have proper names, such as the 2 Regional "
"Operations Command. Multiple sources reference a Regional Operations "
"Command based in the city of Sittwe, identifying subordinate units, areas"
" of operation and other information related to organizations. None of "
"these sources, however, give this organization a numerical identifier. In"
" order to capture information about this organization the Monitor named "
"this unit Unnamed Regional Operations Command at Sittwe and will maintain"
" that name until a source with a numerical identifier can be identified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/methodology.rst:131
msgid ""
"\"Unknown\" organizations exist solely to connect subordinate units to "
"the wider command hierarchy. Since they are a creation of the Monitor "
"they will not have sites, area of operations, memberships or persons "
"attached to them. In contrast, \"Unnamed\" organizations have all of the "
"related attributes of an organization, and can have persons attached to "
"them. The only thing they lack is a proper name. As a final note, "
"additional sourcing would change an \"Unnamed\" organization into a unit "
"with a proper name, whereas additional sourcing could result in the "
"deletion of an \"Unknown\" organization as an actual parent unit would be"
" identified, removing the need for the \"Unknown\" organization to exist."
