Persons Extra
=============

"Persons Extra" is used to extend the data in `Persons`__ to include a person's social media and other online accounts, official webpages, and media materials containing information about how they look and sound. 

It also serves the purpose of grouping resources that are "ipso facto" - resources that are valuable in themselves, and not only as sources for other data points. This provides the Staff Analyst with a collection of audiovisual media resources that can be used to identify and further research the person. For convenience, some of the data usually captured in sources is treated as sustantive data by this format.

Person Extra: Name
------------------

**Description**

Full name of the person, including given, patronym and surnames, as already recorded in the ``person:name`` field of the `Persons`__ sheet.

**Type of field**

Text and numbers

**Example of use**

``Magaji Musa Majia'a``

**Spreadsheet column name**

``persons_extra:name``

**Shortcode**

``px_name``

**Sources**

No.

**Confidence**

No.

**Guidance on use**

This field is used to store the name of the person about whom extra information is being entered. The person must already have an entry in the `Persons`_ sheet. The value must be identical to that in ``person:name``.

This field is duplicated for every row of data about the person.

Person Extra: Unique Identifier
-------------------------------

**Description**

A unique 32 character code assigned to each person in the dataset, as already recorded in the ``person:id:admin`` field of the `Persons`__ sheet.

**Type of field**

**Guidance on use**

This field is used to store the UUID of the person about whom extra information is being entered. The person must already have an entry in the `Persons`_ sheet. The value must be identical to that in ``person:id:admin``.

Person Extra: Gender
--------------------

**Description**

Indicators of a person's sex or gender identity, as observable from available sources.

**Type of field**

Open list, single choice

**Example of use**

``Male``, ``Female``, ``Other``

**Spreadsheet column name**

``person_extra:gender``

**Shortcode**

``px_g``

**Sources**

Yes (``person_extra:gender:source``, ``px_g_s``)

**Confidence**

Yes (``person_extra:gender:confidence``, ``px_g_c``)

**Guidance on use**

This field is used to capture data about the gender of a person, as determined only by the pronouns ("her", "she", "his", "him", etc) used in any available textual sources about this person. We do not infer a person's gender from their name or images of them. 

Echoing the definition used in the `FOAF standard<http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_gender>`__, the ``Person Extra: Gender`` field is not intended to capture the full range of possible biological, social and sexual associated with the word "gender". In the majority of cases the value recorded in this field will be ``male`` or ``female``. However, we have left this field open to include alternatives that are expressed within the available sources about a person.

Where the sources contain no textual indication about the person's gender, the field should be left blank.

Person Extra: Date of Birth

**Description**
