Research Handbook for Security Force Monitor
============================================

About this Research Handbook
----------------------------

This Research Handbook contains information about the data and tools used by Security Force Monitor, a project of the Columbia Law School Human Rights Initiative. Currently, it has three main sections:

-  WhoWasInCommand.com User Guide: The data created by Security Force Monitor is published online on WhoWasInCommand.com, a platform with powerful search functions, clean and interactive views of data on persons, organizations and events.
-  Methodology: Security Force Monitor has a four phase approach to researching a country's security forces. This section outlines our process.
-  Data Model: this section describes the way that Security Force Monitor structures the data it collects, outlines the main entities in use (``persons``,\ ``organizations`` and ``events``) and details how each field is used.

The Research Handbook is a work-in-progress, and is updated during the course of the work of Security Force Monitor.

About Security Force Monitor
----------------------------

The Security Force Monitor works to make police, military and other security forces around the world more transparent and accountable.

Human rights researchers, journalists, advocates, litigators and others engaged in making security forces accountable face a common problem – a lack of clear, detailed information on those forces. Often, answering even simple questions can be difficult:

-  Who is in charge of the specialized anti-riot police unit?
-  What army unit has jurisdiction over what areas?
-  Where did this commander previously serve?
-  When was a particular police unit based in a specific city?

There is a vast amount of public information on security forces around the world, but it is unstructured and scattered among a wide variety of sources, making it prohibitively costly for those engaged in public interest work to understand the security forces of a particular country.

The Security Force Monitor aims to solve this problem and aid those working to make police, military and other security forces accountable. The Monitor analyzes and compiles public information to provide data on: the command hierarchy, location, areas of operation, commanders and the other linkages between units – all tracked through time. The Monitor’s mission and technical offerings have been developed to serve, and in consultation with, a wide range of civil society efforts.

The Security Force Monitor is a project of the `Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute <http://www.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute>`__.
