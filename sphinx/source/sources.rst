Sources
=======

Source: Title
-------------

**Description**

The name of a source.

**Type of field**

Text

**Example of use**

``Stars on their shoulders. Blood on their hands. War crimes committed by the Nigerian military``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:title``

**Shortcode**

``s_t``

**Guidance on use**

Copy the exact title of the source as stated on the source itself. Where the title has multiple parts, such as a subtitle, also include that.

Source: Publication Date
-----

**Description**

Date that a source was published.

**Type of field**

Date (YYYY-MM-DD), fuzzy

**Example of use**

``2016-01-16``, ``2016-01``, ``2016``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:publication_date``

**Shortcode**

``s_pd``

**Guidance on use**

The publication date is usually stated somewhere in the source, but not always. 

This field will accept a full or partial date. Where a source has reprints, use the earliest stated date listed.

Source: Source URL
-----

**Description**

The first and original public online location of the source.

**Type of field**

URL

**Example of use**

``https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/1657/2015/en/``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:url``

**Shortcode**

``s_u``

**Guidance on use**

The URL included here must be for the first and original public online location of the source. Where possible, if a source is republished through a content sharing or syndication system, attempt to find the original location. If you are accessing the source through a restricted or subscription-only gateway (such as LexisNexis or ProQuest), attempt to find the original public URL for a source rather than the URL generated by the gateway service.

Source: Publication Country
-----

**Description**

County in which the publication or publishing organization of the source is based.

**Type of field**

Text, controlled vocabulary

**Example of use**

``United States``, ``Nigeria``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:publication_country``

**Shortcode**

``s_c``

**Guidance on use**

Values for this field are the English language full names of countries contained in the list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, which can be found (`on the ISO website <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/>`__ and on `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements>`__).

Source: Publication Title
-----

**Description**

The name of the publication, or publishing organization, of the source.

**Type of field**

Text

**Example of use**

``Amnesty International``, ``Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional``, ``Daily Independent``, ``The Irrawady``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:publication_title``

**Shortcode**

``s_pt``

**Guidance on use**

This field can cover two sorts of publication:

- The publication in which the source appears, which could be a newspaper, journal or a book.
- Absent a specific publication, include the name of the publishing organization, such as the government organization responsible for a web-page.


Source: Publication Unique Identifier
-----

**Description**

A unique 32 chracter code assigned to each publication from which sources are drawn.

**Type of field**

Text and numbers

**Example of use**

``2190a9b4-8163-47a6-8461-3157f68c3ba3``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:publication_id:admin``

**Shortcode**

``s_pid_a``

**Guidance on use**

This value is a Universally Unique Indentifier (UUID) generated using a computer program. UUIDs can be created easily using either installable or online tools, for example:

- Linux and OSX users: `uuidgen` command line tool.
- On the web: `UUID Generator<https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version>`_.

The field is administrative, providing a reliable way to differentiate between different publications (which in some cases may have the same name).

When a new publication is created directly in WhoWasInCommand, the platform automatically creates a UUID for that source and stores it in this field. If a new publication is created in a spreadsheet, the Staff Researcher must generate a unique identifying number for that publication and copy it into the field ``publication:id:admin`` for every row associated with that specific publication. This manual, copy-and-paste step is a potential source of error and the Staff Researcher must be careful not to re-use a UUID.

Source: Access Point Page(s)
-----

**Description**

The page number at which a source provides information used to evidence a data point.

**Type of field**

Number, number range

**Example of use**

``11``, ``11-12``, ``11,13``, ``11,13,14-19``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:access_point_pages``

**Shortcode**

``s_app``

**Guidance on use**

An access point to a source needs to be created if the material contained in a specific page or page range in that source has been used to evidence a data point. For example, if a source says a unit was called ``1 BAT`` on page 39, create an access point for that source at page 39 - that the UUID of that access point will included in ``unit:name:source``.  If later in the same document, at page 90, it says the person ``Foo Bar`` was the commander of ``1 BAT`` create another access point for that source at page 90 - the UUID for this new access point will included in ``person:posting:source``. 

This field will take a single page number (``11``), multiple single page numbers (``11,13``), a page range (``14-19``) or a comma-separated mix of all three (``11,13,14-19``).

Where an access point is created using this field, the Internet Archive URL specified in ``Source: Access Point Archive URL`` does not need to be updated.

Source: Access Point Access Date
-----

**Description**

Exact date on which the Staff Reseacher looked at the access point.

**Type of field**

Date (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Example of use**

``2019-02-20``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:access_point_access_date``

**Shortcode**

``s_apad``

**Guidance on use**

When a Staff Researcher accesses an access point, they should record the full, exact date in this field.

Source: Access Point Archive URL
-----

**Description**

URL of an Internet Archive capture of the source. 

**Type of field**

URL 

**Example of use**

``https://web.archive.org/web/20150703120013/http://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AFR44/043/2012/en/``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:access_point_archive_url``

**Shortcode**

``s_apau``

**Guidance on use**

A source becomes usable by Staff Researchers when it has an access point. After entering the source's basic details (like ``Source: Title``), the researcher then creates the first access point by specifying an Internet Archive snapshot to use for that source. If the source is not already archived in the Internet Archive, the research must create a new snapshot to use as the access point. Where snapshots for the source already exist in the Internet Archive, the Staff Researcher should find the snapshot that is earliest in time.

In the majority of cases, this will suffice. However, in some cases, we may need to specify more than one Internet Archive snapshot for the same source. The common reason for this is that the source content changes, but the basic details of the source do not. A good example of this is this (dead) URL published by the *Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional* in Mexico: ``http://www.sedena.gob.mx:80/ejercito/comandancias/gur_mil.htm``. It lists the commanders of Mexico's miltary garrisons, and we have included reference to this in our data. The title, initial publication date, publication and basic URL did not change: however, the content did. In each of 24 different captures made by the Internet Archive, the list of commanders is different. In this case, we have a single source with 24 access points: each access point refers to a specific version of that source containing the exact information that we relied upon to create the data.

The example above also illustrates an important point: sometimes a source is only available in an archived form, because its original source URL is no longer online. There are many reasons a link many no longer be live, and this problem is known as "linkrot". In these cases, the Staff Researcher can fill in ``Source: URL`` with a portion of the Internet Archive URL printed after the timestamp: 

``https://web.archive.org/web/20040208204841/http://www.sedena.gob.mx:80/ejercito/comandancias/gur_mil.htm``


Source: Access Point Archive Timestamp
-----

**Description**

Timestamp of the Internet Archive snapshot used to create an access point.

**Type of field**

Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)

**Example of use**

``2004-02-08T20:48:41``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:access_point_archive_timestamp``

**Shortcode**

``s_apat``

**Guidance on use**

Every snapshot made by the Internet Archive contains a timestamp of the time (GMT/UTC) when that snapshot was created. The timestamp is contained in the URL and looks like this:

``20040208204841``

We extract this part of the URL and reformat it to something more human readable (an ISO 8601 format):

``2004-02-08T20:48:41``

The timestamp is a useful quality assurance filter, and is used in the WhoWasInCommand data entry tools as a visual aid to differentiate between access points.


Source: Access Point Unique Identifier
-----

**Description**

A unique 32 character code assigned to each access point.

**Type of field**

Text and numbers

**Example of use**

``1c03ec21-0fae-4243-9de6-686568afc2b8``

**Spreadsheet colum name**

``source:access_point_id:admin``

**Shortcode**

``s_id_a``

**Guidance on use**

This value is a Universally Unique Indentifier (UUID) generated using a computer program. UUIDs can be created easily using either installable or online tools, for example:

- Linux and OSX users: `uuidgen` command line tool.
- On the web: `UUID Generator<https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version>`__.

The field is administrative, providing a reliable way to differentiate between different access points. 

When a new access point is created directly in WhoWasInCommand, the platform automatically creates a UUID for that access point and stores it in this field. If a new accesspoint is created in a spreadsheet, the Staff Researcher must generate a unique identifying number for that person and copy it into the field ``source:access_point_id:admin`` for that specific access point. This manual, copy-and-paste step is a potential source of error and the Staff Researcher must be careful not to re-use a UUID.

Bulk updates made to WhoWasInCommand.com by spreadsheet import are based on the values in this field. For example, changes made in the row ``a407be6a-28e6-4237-b4e9-307f27b1202e`` in the spreadsheet will be applied to the access point  with that UUID in WhoWasInCommand.
